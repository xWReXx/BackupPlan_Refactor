# backup-plan
```
Backup Plan is a progressive web app that connects people displaced 
by natural disasters with people who have extra living space they 
may be willing to donate.  I built Backup Plan as my final capstone 
project in the Galvanize Immserive Software Engineering Program.  The project
required that we use unfamiliar tech to build the app within 10 days.  This repo 
is my continued work on the project after Galvanize.
